About Me

I’m a strategic, detail-oriented professional with a strong foundation in problem-solving, precision, and adaptability — skills sharpened through managing high-stakes projects, coordinating cross-functional teams, and delivering results in high pressure settings. I have applied these strengths to cybersecurity by implementing risk-informed solutions across GRC, threat detection, and compliance.

With a background in project management, advocacy, and hands-on team leadership, I bring both resilience and real-world insight to the evolving security landscape. I’m passionate about safeguarding digital assets, strengthening infrastructure, and enhancing trust by aligning security with equity, transparency, and protection. These values shape how I learn, lead, and contribute to ethical, resilient cybersecurity environments.
